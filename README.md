## My process

It took me about six hours to complete the project. The desktop preview was easy, but as for the mobile preview, I did it in a hurry and did not pay attention to any detail. In the end, I can say that the code works, but I am sure that it is not the best.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I did not learn anything new, but I realized the importance of organizing work and classes

### Continued development

I want to improve the way I name classes and write clean code
